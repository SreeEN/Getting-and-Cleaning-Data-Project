Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

## Project on "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course

The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

### Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:
1. Download the zip file from this URL.
2. Unzip the file.

This will create a directory **UCI HAR Dataset** with all the subdirectories and files structure as was in the zip file.
Make sure that your working directory is **UCI HAR Dataset**.

Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R). It requires the *reshape2* package. If you don't have the package, download it from CRAN.

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, *tidy.csv*.**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the **code book**.
